        Hey! I'm a second year engineering student with an A grade academic record. 
	I would love to have the oppurtunity of working with computer systems and electronics in a professional environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over this summer I want to explore how the fundamentals I have learned in tertiary education so far apply to professional projects. 
	I want to gain the invaluable perspective of working in a team environment with different contributions coming together to make something 
	useful. Additionally I would want to see the how creation and maintenance of projects – both software and hardware realms – are implemented 
	in a professional environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        My interests and passions revolve around seeing how digital technologies' virtual and physical realms interact with each other 
	to be one thing. However I am fundamentally fuelled by being able to solve tricky yet eventually satisfying problems that have an impact 
	on something. My learning is based around being able to manipulate 
	little parts of something to understand the behgaviour of it and be able to use it in the big picture.
      </p>
	<p>
	My academic record is strong evidence of my dedication in problem solving. I am the 2014 Dux of my highschool Mount Maunganui 
	College. Also I am on the 2015 VUW Engineering Faculty's Dean's List. I currently work part time as a lab assistant for the first year 
	mathematics lab in VUW. I have participated in the Bay of Plenty Mashup secondary school competition annually from 2012 to 2014
